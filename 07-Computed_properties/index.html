  <!--Computed properties are cached, meaning the result is saved until its dependencies change. So when quantity changes, the cache will be cleared and the **next time you access the value of inStock , it will return a fresh result, and cache that result.

  With that in mind, it’s more efficient to use a computed property rather than a method for an expensive operation that you don’t want to re-run every time you access it.-->

    <div class="product">
      <div class="product-image">
        <img v-bind:src="image"><!-- the image is now in the computed property, under image()!! So, here we are calling now a computer property!-->
      </div>

      <!--we want to echo our brand and product with computed properties as one string.-->
      <div class="product-info">
        <h1>{{ title }}</h1> <!--We will call this title. The title() is a function in the computed object. This is how we can use the computed properties in a very simple but not practical example. It is unpractical because we could have done this with just a simple concatination. But this is just an example-->

        <p v-if='inStock'>In stock</p>
        <p v-else :class = '{ noSocks: !inStock }'>Out of stock</p>
        <!--This is tricky. Here, v-if should react to true or false. But. inStock is numerical, it has numbers in stead of true/false. Why is this still working?. It is because of the truthy and falsey. -->

        <!--Now when we hover on the blue variant, which has a quantity of zero, inStock will evaluate to false since 0 is “falsey”, so we’ll now see 'Out of Stock' to appear. When we hoover over green socks, which we have 10, 10 is truthy, so the 'In stock' option will be activated.

        .noSocks is a CSS class, that will make the text crossed, if inStock is false

        .noSocks {
          text-decoration: line-through;
        }

        -->

          class = 'color-box' 
          :style = '{ backgroundColor: variant.variantColor }' 
          @mouseover = 'updateProduct(index)'> 
        </div>
        <!--we’ll be setting selectedVariant based on the index that we hover on (green variant has index 0, blue variant has index 1, because in the variants array green has 0 position, blue has 1 position).

        We can add index to our v-for here, like so. So now both variants have their index number. We pass this index as an argument through the 'updateProduct(index)' back to Vue, when the hoovering happens-->
